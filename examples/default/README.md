# Example - Default

No configuration. Uses all defaults to have something working out-of-the-box. 
Uses `docker-compose`.

How to use:

```
./build.sh
./start.sh
browse to http://localhost:8085/demo
./stop.sh
``` 

The local directory `./mapproxy` will be populated with a default config and MP WGSI app.
You can delete the directory `./mapproxy` after use or use that as a starter for your app.
See the other examples for more adavanced setup.
